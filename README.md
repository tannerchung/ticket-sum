# Run the Streamlit interface
streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.port 5000 --server.address 0.0.0.0

# Or run batch processing
python main.py
```

## üìä Usage

### Web Interface
1. Launch the Streamlit application
2. Select sample tickets or enter custom support requests
3. Watch agents collaborate in real-time through the monitoring dashboard
4. Review detailed analysis, action plans, and quality assessments

### Batch Processing
```python
from agents import CollaborativeSupportCrew
from utils import load_ticket_data

# Initialize collaborative crew
crew = CollaborativeSupportCrew()

# Process single ticket
result = crew.process_ticket("TICKET001", "Customer message here")

# Process batch from CSV or Kaggle dataset
df = load_ticket_data()
results = []
for _, row in df.iterrows():
    result = crew.process_ticket(row['ticket_id'], row['message'])
    results.append(result)
```

## üèó Architecture
