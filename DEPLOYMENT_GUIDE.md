# GitHub Deployment Guide - ticket-sum

## Manual Repository Creation (Required)

Since the GitHub token lacks repository creation permissions, here's how to get your code on GitHub:

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/tannerchung) 
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name: `ticket-sum`
4. Description: `Multi-agent AI system for intelligent customer support ticket processing with CrewAI`
5. Make it Public
6. Don't initialize with README (we have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Download Project Files
The project is ready with these key files:
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `.gitignore` - Proper exclusions for Python/Git
- `agents.py` - Multi-agent collaborative system
- `streamlit_app.py` - Web interface (fixed flickering issue)
- `main.py` - Command-line processing
- `config.py` - Configuration management
- `database_service.py` - PostgreSQL integration
- `models.py` - Database models
- `utils.py` - Utility functions
- `pyproject.toml` - Dependencies

### Step 3: Upload to GitHub
You can either:

**Option A: GitHub Web Interface**
1. In your new repo, click "uploading an existing file"
2. Drag and drop all the Python files
3. Commit with message: "Initial commit - Multi-agent support ticket summarizer"

**Option B: Local Git (if you have Git installed locally)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tannerchung/support-ticket-summarizer.git
# Copy all files from this Replit to the cloned directory
cd support-ticket-summarizer
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Multi-agent support ticket summarizer"
git push origin main
```

## Option 2: Repository Archive

I can also create a ZIP archive of all the important files if that's easier for you to download and upload.

## Files Ready for Upload

All files have been prepared with:
- ✅ Proper .gitignore excluding temp files, logs, and sensitive data
- ✅ Comprehensive README with setup instructions
- ✅ Fixed UI flickering issue in Streamlit app
- ✅ Complete multi-agent collaborative system
- ✅ Database integration and analytics
- ✅ Quality monitoring with DeepEval
- ✅ LangSmith tracing integration

## Next Steps

Let me know which approach you prefer:
1. Manual upload to GitHub (files are ready)
2. Create ZIP archive for download
3. Any specific organization or naming preferences

The project is production-ready with comprehensive documentation and all the collaborative features working properly.
