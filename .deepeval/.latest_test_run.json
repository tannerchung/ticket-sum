This issue is classified under 'technical_support' due to its technical nature and potential impact on security. - The vulnerability could lead to significant security implications, such as data breaches or system compromises, necessitating immediate attention and resolution. 3. **Technical Details, Customer Sentiment, and Underlying Problems**: - **Technical Details**: The issue involves a security vulnerability in an API endpoint, which is a critical component of the system's architecture. The exact nature of the vulnerability (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting) is not specified but is crucial for determining the appropriate remediation steps. - **Customer Sentiment**: Although the specific sentiment is not detailed, the classification of the issue as 'critical' suggests that the customer is likely concerned about the potential risks and is seeking urgent assistance.", "expectedOutput": "Classification: The", "context": ["Critical security vulnerability found in your API endpoint.
